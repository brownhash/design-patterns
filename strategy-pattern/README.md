# Strategy pattern

It defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, 
and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithms 
vary independently of the clients that use it.

## How?

The implementation that we did in the [problem](../problem#problem) 
was implemented using Strategy Pattern. So, if you missed anything 
you can go [back](../problem#problem) and go through it again.

> Favor composition over inheritance.

> Creating systems using Composition gives you a lot more flexibility. 
> Not only it lets you encapsulate a family of algorithms into their
