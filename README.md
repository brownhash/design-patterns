## Learnings

> Design patterns don't go directly into your code, 
> they first go into your brain.

> One of the secrets to creating maintainable OO systems is 
> thinking about how they might change in the future, and these 
> design principles address those issues.

> Frameworks and libraries are not design patterns, they are 
> specific implementations that we link to our code.
